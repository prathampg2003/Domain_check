# Domain Checker


## Overview

The **Domain Checker** is a simple yet powerful tool that checks the DNS records of a given domain to ensure proper email configuration and security. This tool verifies the presence of key DNS records, including MX, SPF, and DMARC, which are essential for managing email deliverability and preventing spoofing.

## Features

- **MX Record Check**: Validates if the domain can receive emails by checking for MX (Mail Exchange) records.
- **SPF Record Check**: Ensures that the domain has a valid SPF (Sender Policy Framework) record to prevent email spoofing.
- **DMARC Record Check**: Checks for the presence of a DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) record to improve email security.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface to input domain names.
